msgid "`Free Python Games`_ is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games intended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code and designed for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of several classic arcade games are included."

msgid "Python is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the world and available for free from `Python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_. Python includes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. The Standard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce programming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in `Free Python Games`_ are implemented using Python and its Turtle module."
